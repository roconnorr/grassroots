                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Grass Roots Maintenance is about quality, friendly service at affordable prices. While still only small, Grass Roots has been steadily growing since it started in late 2015. Proudly locally owned and operated, Grass Roots currently services properties all over the Waikato.</p>
                <p>Although Grass Roots takes a more casual approach to business, this in no way impacts our dedication to providing professional quality solutions to your maintenance needs.</p>
                <p>While we currently focus on outdoor maintenance: Lawn Mowing, Pruning, Window Washing and Soft Washing Plaster Exteriors, we are also available for interior Paint and Plaster. Or if you need help with anything else feel free to contact us on info@grassrootsmaintenance.com</p>
